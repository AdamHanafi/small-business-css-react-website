## A basic website I built for a small local business

This project was started using the base from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  

This project is openly available to anyone who wishes to use it as a template.

You can see the live version at [**Live**](https://ankcreations-c52dc.firebaseapp.com/).

### Responsive:

Through various media queries at varying resolution along with the base design, the website has a responsive design while also having some notable changes to the overall layout at times to ensure a better user experience.

### Images:

The images in the project are currently hosted on [**Imgur**](https://imgur.com/) 

You'll find the pictures used in the website are stored in an array under that page's component. Each index being a specific tab in that menu.
